    <h1>Advent Secrets Quest Headers</h1>
    
    <div class="quest-header">
        <h2>1ª Advent Door</h2>
        <p>Behind the first Advent Door answers a sour-faced soul devoid of festive joy. Krampus will lend you some decorations on one condition–give his 'special' cookies to Mr. Kringle and make sure he takes a bite...</p>
        <p><em>Next stop, the home of an icy angel!</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quest-header">
        <h2>2ª Advent Door</h2>
        <p>Behind the second Advent Door answers an angelic smile masking a bitter jealousy. Polar Seraph wanted to be the angel atop Mr. Kringle's tree but alas, the star was chosen instead. Help boost Polar Seraph's confidence in exchange for some decorations.</p>
        <p><em>Next stop, a resident perfect for keeping your drink cold!</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quest-header">
        <h2>3ª Advent Door</h2>
        <p>Behind the third Advent Door answers a friend oh so square. Ether Cube has some tree decorations in the back, he'll fetch them if you agree to hang out with him... Most of his guests get too cold and leave early.</p>
        <p><em>Next stop, shake, shake, shake!</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quest-header">
        <h2>4ª Advent Door</h2>
        <p>Behind the fourth Advent Door answers a fragile fellow literally full of festive goodness. Give Snowglobe a (light) shake to find his holiday decorations!</p>
        <p><em>Next stop, Mr. Kringle's right-hand dragon!</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quest-header">
        <h2>5ª Advent Door</h2>
        <p>Behind the fifth Advent Door answers the real brains behind the operation. Jingle Keeper's work often goes unseen while Mr. Kringle takes all the credit! He'll happily give you some decorations if you lend a hand in distributing the presents.</p>
        <p><em>Next stop, the shack beside the cemetery...</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quest-header">
        <h2>6ª Advent Door</h2>
        <p>Behind the sixth Advent Door answers a bony fiend with a guilty pleasure of the festivities! Grave Lurker will dig up some haunted decorations for you if put in a good word about him to Mr. Kringle.</p>
        <p><em>Next stop, the head of the Kringle Army!</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quest-header">
        <h2>7ª Advent Door</h2>
        <p>Behind the seventh Advent Door answers the defender of the North. However, when Polar General isn't keeping out the danger from Mr. Kringle's grotto, he can be found knitting homemade decorations just for you.</p>
        <p><em>Next stop, don't touch!</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quest-header">
        <h2>8ª Advent Door</h2>
        <p>Behind the eighth Advent Door answers a touchy grouch not wanting to be disturbed. Please take these festive decorations off its hands... If Nyx finds them, it'll be let go from her Unchained Sensate Squad.</p>
        <p><em>Next stop, a freezing heat!</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quest-header">
        <h2>9ª Advent Door</h2>
        <p>Behind the ninth Advent Door answers a not-so-innocent heat source. FrostFire's warm house is found along the route to the North. You'll have to take its decorations without it knowing, otherwise you're toast...</p>
        <p><em>Next stop, the brother twin!</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quest-header">
        <h2>10ª Advent Door</h2>
        <p>Behind the tenth Advent Door answers a resident of Snowglobe Town! Living on the outskirts of Kringle Kingdom, Globalio will gladly repay you with decorations for your help last year saving his town.</p>
        <p><em>Next stop, the sister twin!</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quest-header">
        <h2>11ª Advent Door</h2>
        <p>Behind the eleventh Advent Door answers another resident of Snowglobe Town! Globalia is also on her way to Kringle Kingdom so she's happy to have a familiar face to join her for the way.</p>
        <p><em>Next stop, the lair of an arctic predator...</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quest-header">
        <h2>12ª Advent Door</h2>
        <p>Behind the twelfth Advent Door answers Kringle Kingdom's untamed guard dragon! Dracarctic Predator is Mr. Kringle's beloved pet. It has some decorations in its lair, just don't wake it up!</p>
        <p><em>Next stop, five is the número de la suerte!</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quest-header">
        <h2>Última Advent Door</h2>
        <p>Behind the final Advent Door answers the five-pointed star! High Cinco has the best starry decorations; that's why Mr. Kringle has left her in charge of the big Christmas tree switch-on! 3...2...1... Happy Holidays from Mr. Kringle and his Kingdom!</p>
